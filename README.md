1. **Importing and Cleaning:**
    - We'll load the dataset and handle any missing values.
    - Extract RAM and storage information from the description.
    - Extract brand names from product names.

2. **Descriptive Statistics:**
    - We'll explore summary statistics for numerical columns like price, ratings, and reviews.

3. **Visualizations (4):**
    - Distribution of prices by RAM and storage.
    - Average ratings by brand.
    - Distribution of ratings.

### Project Overview
This project involves cleaning the data, and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The entire process showcases skills in web scraping, data cleaning, and visualization.

### Data Sources
The data was scraped from the [Flipkart mobile dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmars1010/filpkart-mobiles), focusing on smart mobile phones with varying price ranges.

### Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

### Cleaning Process
The cleaning script handles missing values, extracts RAM and storage information, and standardizes the data format.

### EDA Process
The exploratory data analysis script visualizes the cleaned data to uncover patterns and insights.

### Key Findings
- **Pricing Trends:**
    - Wide price range, with budget and mid-range mobiles.
    - Premium brands have higher price points with distinct features.
- **Brand Popularity:**
    - Certain brands dominate the market share.
- **Feature Impact:**
    - RAM, storage, and battery capacity correlate positively with price.
- **Customer Insights:**
    - Reviews highlight specific features like battery life, camera quality, and performance.

### Project Impact
- Scraped data for over 1000 mobile phones.
- Utilized web scraping tools efficiently.
- Processed raw data using Pandas.
- Visualized insights through Matplotlib.
